            Hello love, <br>
            I’ll be honest, I have no idea who you are or when we’ll meet, but if you truly are the one, I know you will be well worth the wait. I can’t wait to hear about your dreams and goals and ambitions. To see if we have the same ones or if they’re completely different. I wonder if you’ll be an engineer in my field or someone in a completely different industry. How did we meet? What did we first think of eachother? Was it love as first sight or was it something we realized after years of friendship? Do you want to live in a bustling city? Or do you want to settle down somewhere more peaceful? So many things that I don't know now, but will be essential to my future. <br>
            I wonder what you’re doing right now. Are you in love with someone else? Or are you also thinking about me? I hope you’re doing well though. I hope you’re living your life and enjoying it right now. I hope you’re as happy and healthy as can be. There’s so much I don’t know about you yet, but here’s some things I do know. I know that you’ll be very patient, kind, and loving. I know that you’ll be my rock, the one to keep me grounded when I get too excited. I know that you’ll take care of me just like I will take care of you. I know that you will make me a better person and I hope that i’m able to do the same for you. I know that I will love you, truly and properly. I know all this because I swore it to myself and now I swear it to you. I don’t have a lot of requirements when it comes to the person I end up spending my life with, all I know is that I won’t settle anyone who doesn’t treat me right. That’s all I really need and that’s all that you have to be. I know your out there somewhere and I hope your making your way to me as fast as you can, because i’m doing my best to get to you as well.
            <br><br>
            See you soon, my love.
