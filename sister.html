                I love you so much, I don’t know if you can even comprehend it. You’re so much younger than me and that makes it so much harder for me to get closer to you.. I am really not good with children and it hurts me so much that I end up hurting you as well but it’s just so difficult for me to treat you like a child and not al equal, but i’m learning. There’s so much in life that you have to be sheltered from (for now) and it’s counter to my nature to shelter people from reality. It’s honestly my belief that anyone who doesn’t know how life works needs to be slapped into reality. And i’m so sad that sometimes that part of me comes out with you. You’re just an 8 year old little baby and I know that life isn’t fair but this isn’t the time for you to know that. I used to tell myself that maybe I could just get closer to you once you’re old enough to face the truths of life, but now I know that that’s just a lame excuse and that it would be to late then anyway. That’s why now I really really try my best to be your big sister. You’ll face the world when you need to and I’ll be there for you when the time comes. For now I’m just going to hold your hand as you go through life and be the best Achi I can be. Although sometimes I may be a bit brash, I am always trying and i’m always for sure going to love you.
