                Hey Yanna,<br>
                I wonder if you still remember what we meant to each other. I remember the sacrifices we made just to see each other every week. I remember that time you went to the US and I would stay awake till 7AM just to keep talking to you. And I also remember you staying awake till 3 AM even though you were really sleepy just to keep talking to me. I’m not sure if it was the same for you but the years I had with you as my best friend we’re the best years of my life. You were one of the most important people in the world to me. <br>
                Then it got messy and everything went wrong... <br>
                When it was all going wrong I used to think it was all your fault since it was you who was hurting me, but now I can see that maybe I was wrong because I should never have blamed you in the first place. Relationships are about forgiveness and not finding fault. I guess I realized that too late and now there’s nothing I can even do anymore. Our friendship has fallen to the wayside and no matter how hard I try to reach out, you don’t want to. The first time this happened I still blamed you. Why wouldn’t you accept my apology? Don’t you care about what we had? But now I can see why. There’s a fundamental part of my personality back then that was too selfish to see that I was also doing things wrong, and now that I realize it, There’s nothing I can do but learn. Use this information to do right by my new relationships and treat others right. I know that you and I are done now, but I just wanted to say thank you, because you were my best friend during my formative years and you are probably the reason I am who I am today. I’m not sure how I’d turn out if you hadn’t been there with me, but I know I would be very different from myself now. Losing you hurt like hell, but i know that because I knew you, I have been changed for good.
