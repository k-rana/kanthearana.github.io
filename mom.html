            Dear Momma, <br>
            I feel like everything Iâ€™m about to say, Iâ€™ve told you before, but you deserve to hear it all again because you are the best mother. I remember that back in high school so many of my friends would say that they wish their mom was like you. Thankfully even before, I already recognized how great you were. So great that I really wish that my relationship with my future children will be just like ours now. You were always able to trust me so much and yet somehow I would never take advantage or abuse it (maybe Iâ€™m the one whoâ€™s great pala not u ðŸ¤”), Iâ€™m able to tell you <em>almost </em> everything, Iâ€™m able to just talk to you and tell the truth and not feel like theres anything off limits.
            Even though I already though of you as a great mother way back then, I think that recently our relationship has improved even more. Theres was so many things that you did for me then that I was never able to appreciate until now. Now, I can really understand the sacrifices that you have to make whenever I as you to bring me somewhere, whereas before I wouldnâ€™t even think much of asking you to do something for me. This is why I really want to learn how to drive as soon as possible, to be able to chauffeur you instead of the other way around. 
            In the same vein, I know I already told you this, but I promise to buy you a home which is at least equivalent to how much youâ€™ve had to spend on my tuition for all these years. Even still, I know that this isnâ€™t equivalent to all the things youâ€™ve spent on me and all the sacrifices youâ€™ve made for me,  but I hope, as I get older, Iâ€™ll be able to pay you back for everything youâ€™ve ever done for me.
            <br><br>
            Love, kiki
